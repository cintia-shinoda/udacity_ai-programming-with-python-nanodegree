# 2. Arithmetic Operators

| Symbol | Operation |
|:---:|:---:|
| + | addition |
| - | subtraction |
| * | multiplication |
| / | division |
| % | mod (the remainder after dividing) |
| ** | exponentiation |
| // | the rounded result of a division to the nearest integer |

- The usual order of mathematical operations holds in Python
- [Bitwise Operators](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) are special operators in Python

# 5. Variables and Assignment Operators
- whatever term is on the left side, is now a name for whatever value is on the right side. 
- once a value has been assigned to a variable name, you can access the value from the variable name
`mv_population = 74728`
- to assign multiple varibles at once:
```
x = 3
y = 4
z = 5
```

or

```x, y, z = 3, 4, 5```

- variables names should be descriptive of the values they hold
    - only use ordinary letters, numbers and underscores
    - need to start with a letter or underscore
    - can't have spaces
    - can't use reserved words or built-in identifiers

#### keywords in Python

||||||
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| False | class | finally | is | return|
| None | continue | for | lambda | try |
| True | def | from | nonlocal | while |
| and | del | global | not | with |
| as | elif | if | or | yield |
| assert | else | import | pass | |
| break | except | in | raise | |

- use all lowercase and underscores to separate words (snakecase)
<br><br>

## Assignment Operators

| symbol | example | equivalent |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `=` | `x = 2` | `x = 2` |
| `+=` | `x += 2` | `x = x + 2` |
| `-=` | `x -= 2` | `x = x - 2` |
| `*=` | `x *= 2` | `x = x * 2` |

# 8. Integers and Floats
- data types used for numeric values
    - **int:** for integer values
    - **float:** for decimal ou floating point values
- to convert:
``` python
x = int(4.7)  # x = 4
y = float(4)  # y = 4.0 
```

- to check the type:
``` python
print(type(x))  # int
print(type(y))  # float
```

- [the float or approximation, for 0.1 is slightly more than 0.1](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html), when added several of them together there will be a difference between the mathematically correct answer and the one that Python creates
``` python
print(.1 + .1 + .1 == 3)
# False
```

## Python Best Practices
- Although how you format the code doesnâ€™t affect how it runs, following standard style guidelines makes code easier to read and consistent among different developers on a team.

[PEP8 Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

- limit each line of code to 80 characters

[Why is 80 characters the "standard" limit for code width?](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width)
<br><br><br>

- Traceback means "What was the programming doing when it broke"! This part is usually less helpful than the very last line of your error.

- 2 types of errors to look out for:
    - **exceptions:** is a problem that occurs when the code is running
    - **syntax:** is a problem detected when Python checks the code before it runs it
- for more about [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.htmlhttps://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
<br><br><br>



# 10. Booleans, Comparison Operators, and Logical Operators
- **bool:**
    - data type
    - can be `True` or `False` or encoded as 1 or 0, respectively

#### Comparison Operators
| Symbol | Operation |
|:---:|:---:|
| `<` | less than |
| `>` | greater than |
| `<=` | less than or equal to |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to |
| `==` | equal to |
| `!=` | not equal to

#### Logical Operators
| Symbol | Operation |
|:---:|:---:|
| `and` | evaluates if all provideed statements are True |
| `or` | evaluates if at least of many statements is True |
| `not` | flips the bool value |

# 13. Strings
- **string (```str```):** data type for immutable ordered sequences of characters (e.g. letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols)
- to create strings: 
```python
print("hello")  # double quotes
print('hello')  # single quotes
```

- to assign a string to a variable
```python
welcome_message = "Hello, welcome to Udacity!"
print(welcome_message)
```

- when we want quotation marks in our strings:
  - place the string in single quotes
  ```python
  pet_halibut = 'why should I be tarred with the epithet "loony" merely because I have a pet halibut?'
  ```
  - use a backslash to escape quotes
    ```python
    salesman = '"I think you\'re an encyclopaedia salesman"'
    ```
- operations with strings:
  - to put strings together(concatenate) ```+```  
  ```python
  first_word = "Hello"
  second_word = "There"
  print(first_word + second_word)
  # HelloThere

  print(first_word + " " + second_word)
  # Hello There
  ```
  - to repeat strings ```*```
  ```python
  word = "Hello"
  print(word * 5)
  # HelloHelloHelloHelloHello
  ```

- ```len()``` : built-in function that returns the length (in strings is the number of characters in the string) of an object - will always be a integer
  ```python
  udacity_length = len("Udacity")
  print(udacity_length)
  # 7

  print(len("ababa") / len("ab"))
  # 2.5
  ```

- you can index into strings
```python
first_word = "Hello"

first_word[0]
# H
first_word[1]
# e
```

# 16. Type and Type Conversion
- 4 data types so far:
  - `int`
  - `float`
  - `bool`
  - `string`

- check the data type:
  ```python
  print(type(633))
  # int

  print(type(633.0))
  # float

  print(type("633"))
  # str

  print(type(True))
  # bool
  ```

- `int` from a `float`:
  ```python
  count = int(4.0)
  print(count)
  print(type(count))
  # 4
  # class 'int'
  ```

- 
  ```python
  house_number = 13
  street_name = "The Crescent"
  town_name = "Belmont"
  print(type(house_number))
  # class 'int'

  address = str(house_number) + " " + street_name + ", " + town_name
  print(address)
  # 13 The Crescent, Belmont
<br><br><br>

# 18. Solution: Type and Type Conversion
## Solution: Total Sales
  ```python
  weekly_sales = int(mon_sales) + int(tues_sales) + int(wed_sales) + int(thurs_sales) + int(fri_sales)
  weekly_sales = str(weekly_sales)  #convert the type back!!
  print("This week's total sales: " + weekly_sales)
  ```
<br><br><br>



# 19. String Methods
# Functions
- `len`(this)
- `type`(12)
- `print`("Hello world")

## Methods in Python
- behaves similarly to a function
- are specific to the data type
- are called using dot notation

  - `.title()`
  ```python
  print("cintia shinoda".title())
    # Cintia Shinoda
  ```

  - `.islower()`
  ```python
  full_name = "cintia shinoda"
  print(full_name.islower())
  # True
  ```

  - `.count()`
  ```python
  print("One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.".count('fish'))
  # 4
  ```

### some other methods possible with any string:
| | | | | | |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `.capitalize()` | `.encode()`| `.format()` | `.isalpha()` | `.islower()` |`.istitle()`|
| `.casefold()` | `.endswith()`| `.format_map()` | `.isdecimal()` | `.isnumeric()` | `.isupper()` |
| `.center()` | `.expandtabs()` | `.index()` | `.isdigit()` | `.isprintable()` | `.join()` |
| `.count()` | `.find()` | `.isalnum()` | `.isidentifier()` | `.isspace()` | `.ljust()` |

- each of these methods accepts the string itself as the 1st. argument of the method - but they also could receibe additional arguments that are passed inside the parentheses

```python
my_string = "cintia shinoda"

my_string.islower()
# True

my_string.count('a')
# 2

my_string.find('a')
# 3
```

### one important string method: `.format()`
```python
print("Mohammed has {} balloons".format(27))
# Mohammed has 27 balloons
```

```python
animal = "dog"
action = "bite"
print("Does your {} {}?".format(animal, action))
# Does your dog bite?
```

```python
maria_string = "Maria loves {} and {}"
print(maria_string.format("math", "statistics"))
# Maria loves math and statistics
```

<br><br><br>



# 21. Another String Method - `.split()`
- returns a data container called a list
- this list contains the words from the input string
- has two additional arguments (sep and maxsplit)
  - *sep* 
    - sep argument stands for "separator", 
    - can be used to identify how the string should be split up 
    - whitespace characters (space, tab, return, newline) or specific punctuation (comma, dashes)
    - if not provided, the default separator is whitespace
  - *maxplit*
    - provides the maximum number of splits
    - gives maxsplit + 1 number of elements in the new list, with the remaining string being returned as the last element in the list

```python
new_str = "The cow jumped over the moon."
new_str.split()
# ['The', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'moon.']
```

```python
new_str.split(' ', 3)  # separator is space and the maxsplit is set to 3
# ['The', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over the moon.']
```

```python
# using period as a separator
new_str.split('.')
# ['The cow jumped over the moon', '']
```

```python
# using no separators but with maxsplit argument of 3
new_str.split(None, 3)
# ['The', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over the moon.']
```
<br><br><br>



# 22. Quiz: String Methods Practice
Below, we have a string variable that contains the first verse of the poem, [If by Rudyard Kipling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E2%80%94). Remember, \n is a special sequence of characters that causes a line break (a new line).

```python
verse = "If you can keep your head when all about you\n  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n  But make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n  Or being lied about, donâ€™t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, donâ€™t give way to hating,\n  And yet donâ€™t look too good, nor talk too wise:"
```

Use the code editor below to answer the following questions about verse and use Test Run to check your output in the quiz at the bottom of this page.

1. What is the length of the string variable verse?
2. What is the index of the first occurrence of the word 'and' in verse?
3. What is the index of the last occurrence of the word 'you' in verse?
4. What is the count of occurrences of the word 'you' in the verse?

You will need to refer to Python's [string methods documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html).

```python
verse = "If you can keep your head when all about you\n  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n  But make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n  Or being lied about, donâ€™t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, donâ€™t give way to hating,\n  And yet donâ€™t look too good, nor talk too wise:"
print(verse)

# Use the appropriate functions and methods to answer the questions above
# Bonus: practice using .format() to output your answers in descriptive messages!

# 1. 
str_length = len(verse)
print("The length of the string variable verse is: {}".format(str_length))

# 2.
first_and = verse.find('and')
print("The index of the first occurrence of the word 'and' in verse is {}".format(first_and))

# 3.
last_u = verse.rfind('you')
print("The index of the last occurrence of the word 'you' in verse is {}".format(last_u))

# 4.
count_you = verse.count('you')
print("The count of occurrences of the word 'you' in verse is {}".format(count_you))
```

print(verse, "\n")

print("Verse has a length of {} characters.".format(len(verse)))
print("The first occurence of the word 'and' occurs at the {}th index.".format(verse.find('and')))
print("The last occurence of the word 'you' occurs at the {}th index.".format(verse.rfind('you')))
print("The word 'you' occurs {} times in the verse.".format(verse.count('you')))
```

## Version 2
```python
verse = "If you can keep your head when all about you\n  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,\nIf you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,\n  But make allowance for their doubting too;\nIf you can wait and not be tired by waiting,\n  Or being lied about, donâ€™t deal in lies,\nOr being hated, donâ€™t give way to hating,\n  And yet donâ€™t look too good, nor talk too wise:"
print(verse, "\n")

message = "Verse has a length of {} characters.\nThe first occurence of the \
word 'and' occurs at the {}th index.\nThe last occurence of the word 'you' \
occurs at the {}th index.\nThe word 'you' occurs {} times in the verse."

length = len(verse)
first_idx = verse.find('and')
last_idx = verse.rfind('you')
count = verse.count('you')

print(message.format(length, first_idx, last_idx, count))
```

# 24. "There's a Bug in my Code"
## Debugging Code
- to remove bugs
- it's important to develop effective coding habits and mental calmness
- with determined persistence, you can prevail over these bugs!
- You might keep an ongoing page of notes on them

### Understanding Common Error Messages
- **"ZeroDivisionError: division by zero"**
- **"SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing"**
  - This message is often produced when you have accidentally left out something
  - This can easily happen with code syntax involving pairs, like beginning and ending quotes
- **"TypeError: len() takes exactly one argument (0 given)"**
  - if I accidentally do not include the required number of arguments when I'm calling a function (in the example, len)
  - This message tells me how many arguments the function requires (one in this case), compared with how many I gave it (0)

### Search for Your Error Message
- Google search or StackOverflow

### Use Print Statements to Help Debugging
- Adding print statements temporarily into your code can help you see which code lines have been executed before the error occurs
